<h3>Background:</h3>
Atliq Hardware supplies its products to multiple stores, including Surge Store, Nomad Store, Excel Store, and Electricalsara stores, and maintains offices across India. However, the company has observed a downward trend in sales, prompting the Sales Director to initiate a data analysis project. Regional managers from different regions, including north, south, east, west, and central India, have been tasked with providing insights into the sales performance in their respective areas.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<h3>Objective</h3>

The Sales Director of Atliq Hardware aims to gain insights into the sales performance across various regions of India and understand the factors contributing to the decline.
